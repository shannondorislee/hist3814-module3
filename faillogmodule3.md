# Module 3 Faillog

## Entry 1
I successfully downloaded teh correspondance with the Republic of Texas data and opened up the file. But, I wasn't reading the instructions carefully enough and deleted the list of index letters instead of everything else. So, I'm going to delete the file and try again.

## Entry 2
I decided that I'm going to make a new repo for the first exercise to track my gits better.

## Entry 3
So, I started deleting all the text I didn't need but it was taking way too long. (Sat for about 10 minutes holding the down button highlighting the unneeded text). The tutorial video showed that you can do it in Sublime a lot quicker so I'm going to do that with the rest to speed this up a bit.

## Entry 4
Deleting using Sublime was much faster and everything uploaded successfully. However, I don't have permission to write in texas.txt. Hopefully this won't be a problem later 

## Entry 5
So, I did need edit permissions. What I did after some googling and trial and error was copy texas.txt into another text file that I could edit. I tried to give myself permissions, but I couldn't quite figure out how. This way was a lot quicker anyway so I think this is a win for me. :) 

## Entry 6
So I successfully used grep and sed commands but I already added and saved some files with tildas. Gonna go back and delete the extra tildas.

## Entry 7
I decided not to remove the tildas because it would take a while and I'm a little lazy. I did successfully move everything into index.txt though, so I don't think it's really much of a problem.

## Entry 8
Removing page numbers, tildes, and tos were all a breeze. Having extra tildes also proved not a problem since they were all eventually removed in the end.
